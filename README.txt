Introduction:
Efficient management of academic timetables is a persistent challenge for educational institutions. Manual timetable creation often results in scheduling conflicts, inefficient allocation of resources, and significant administrative overhead. The Time Table Builder project addresses these challenges by providing an automated, user-friendly, and robust solution for timetable management using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). This report details the objectives, system design, implementation, and key features of the project, as well as the object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts utilized throughout.

Project Objectives:
The primary aim of the Time Table Builder is to automate the process of creating, editing, and managing academic timetables. The specific objectives are:
1. To provide an intuitive GUI for managing classrooms, instructors, and courses.
2. To enable both manual and automatic generation of timetables, minimizing scheduling conflicts.
3. To ensure data persistence and security through file-based storage.
4. To demonstrate the application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and composition in a real-world project.

System Architecture and Design:
The project is structured around several core modules, each encapsulated as a Java class. The architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, separating data management (Model), user interface (View), and event handling (Controller).

Key Classes and Their Roles
1. TimeTableBuilder: The entry point of the application, responsible for launching the GUI in a thread-safe manner using the Event Dispatch Thread.
2. Theme: Centralizes all GUI styling, including colors, fonts, and custom components, ensuring a consistent and modern look across the application.
3. DataManager: Handles all data operations, including reading from and writing to CSV files for classrooms, instructors, courses, and timetables. This class abstracts file I/O from the                   rest of the application, promoting modularity.
4. HomePage & MainMenu: Serve as navigation hubs for users, presenting options to manage different aspects of the timetable system.
5. AddClassroomForm, AddInstructorForm, AddCourseForm: Dedicated forms for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on classrooms, instructors, and courses. Each form uses Swing components such as JTextField, JComboBox, and JCheckBox for user input.
6. TimetableDisplay & TimetableGridView: Facilitate manual timetable creation and visualization. Users can assign courses to specific time slots and view the entire timetable in a grid format.
7. AutoScheduler: Implements automatic timetable generation by intelligently assigning courses and instructors to available slots, ensuring conflict-free schedules.

Implementation Details:
GUI Development
The GUI is developed using Java Swing, leveraging components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JComboBox, and JTable. Each window or form is implemented as a class extending JFrame, demonstrating the use of inheritance. The GUI is event-driven, with ActionListener interfaces attached to buttons and other interactive elements to handle user actions.

The Theme class encapsulates all styling logic, providing reusable methods for creating custom-styled buttons and fields. This approach ensures a cohesive user experience and simplifies future modifications to the application's appearance.

Data Management and Exception Handling
All data is stored in CSV files within a dedicated /data/ directory. The DataManager class provides static methods for saving, loading, updating, and deleting records. Exception handling is rigorously implemented to manage file I/O errors and invalid user inputs. For example, when a user enters non-numeric data in a numeric field, the application catches the NumberFormatException and displays an informative error dialog using JOptionPane.

Timetable Generation and Conflict Checking
Manual timetable creation is facilitated through forms where users select classrooms, instructors, courses, days, and time slots. The system checks for scheduling conflicts before saving any entry, ensuring that no classroom or instructor is double-booked.

The AutoScheduler module automates timetable generation by analyzing available resources and constraints, producing optimal schedules that avoid conflicts. Users can review, modify, and save these automatically generated timetables.

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
The project extensively applies OOP principles:
1. Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its data and methods, exposing only necessary interfaces.
2. Inheritance: All GUI forms inherit from JFrame, enabling code reuse and consistency.
3. Abstraction: Data operations are abstracted through the DataManager class, and GUI styling is abstracted via the Theme class.
4. Composition: GUI windows are composed of multiple Swing components, and timetable entries are composed of classroom, instructor, and course objects.

5. Polymorphism: All forms can be treated as JFrame objects, allowing flexible window management.

Features:
1. Add, view, edit, and delete classrooms, instructors, and courses.
2. Manual and automatic timetable creation.
3. Real-time conflict checking and resolution.
4. Data persistence using CSV files.
5. Consistent and attractive GUI with custom theming.
6. Comprehensive exception handling and user feedback.

Conclusion:
The Time Table Builder project successfully demonstrates how Java Swing and OOP principles can be combined to create a practical, efficient, and user-friendly timetable management system. The modular design ensures ease of maintenance and scalability, while robust error handling and intuitive interfaces enhance user experience. This project not only streamlines academic scheduling but also serves as a strong example of applied software engineering practices.c
